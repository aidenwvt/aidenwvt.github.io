I'm a current Junior at Virginia Tech studying Computer Engineering with an emphasis in Networking and Cybersecurity. I've been interested in this field for most of my life and have ever gotten Network+ and Security+ certifications self studying on my own. I'm very passionate in embedded development, cybersecurity, and modding video games. You can view my contact information on the left hand side, and get a more in depth explanation of what I've done through the tabs on the top of my screen. Feel free to contact me at any of my contacts listed, and I'll try my best to get back as soon as possible.
